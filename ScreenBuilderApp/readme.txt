There are can be several improvements  in this application:

Storyboard placement in XAML: The storyboard can be placed directly in XAML, allowing for better organization and separation of design and functionality.

Code-behind cleanup using attached helpers: By utilizing attached helpers, we can remove unnecessary code from the code-behind page, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

Improved drag and drop functionality: In order to perform drag and drop operations, it is necessary to select the item before attempting the action. This can be avoided
